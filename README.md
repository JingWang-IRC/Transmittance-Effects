# Transmittance-Effects
Implement refraction, reflection, Fresnel component, chromatic dispersion with OpenGL and C++.
Refraction and reflection are what them mean.
Regarding Fresnel compnent, this is a component to decide the ratio of refraction and reflection to make the rendering more realistic.
As for chromatic dispersion, this effect is implemented by setting the refractive indexes of red/green/blue light to different values which made the surface of the objects as colourful as a rainbow. 
[A short demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWi5p6D2Owo) has been uploaded to Youtube.
All the code are in the **Assignment2** folder, while the 3D models are in the **Release** folder.
